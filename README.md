# Newtonian sheet method.

Code here is a not-quite-complete implementation of the sheet method.


## Building
A `Makefile` is provided to compile. Most users can compile simply via:
```
make
```
And the executable `collisionless_tests` will be created. If you wish to edit
the build configuration, the file `Makefile.inc` should be used.


## TODO

 - Figure out units
 - Work on lightcone / raytracing aspect
 - Window function correction, add'l deposition schemes, etc?
 - Parallelize
